All code used in the project "Analysis of free-surface fluid flows of increasing complexity using data-driven methods" is available in this repository. The flow data can be provided upon request. The implementation RPCA is adapted from Isebel Scherl (https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.5.054401#:~:text=RPCA%20is%20a%20robust%20variant%20of%20principal%20component,a%20sparse%20matrix%20of%20outliers%20and%20corrupt%20entries.). Additionally, the reconstruction for limited sensor data builds upon the framework established by Callaham et al. (https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.4.103907).
